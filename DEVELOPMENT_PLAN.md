# SVG Editor Development Plan

## Project Overview
Create a web-based SVG editor using **React + TypeScript** that allows users to:
- View SVG files
- Select individual SVG elements by clicking
- Move/drag elements to new positions
- Resize elements with handles
- Change element z-ordering (bring to front/send to back)

## Why React?
React provides significant advantages for this type of interactive editor:
- **Component-based architecture**: Easy to create reusable UI components (selection handles, toolbars, panels)
- **State management**: Built-in state handling for selection, transforms, and editor state
- **Event handling**: Simplified event delegation and synthetic events
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM optimizations and React's reconciliation
- **Developer experience**: Hot reloading, excellent TypeScript integration, rich ecosystem
- **Testing**: Excellent testing tools (React Testing Library, Jest)
- **Maintainability**: Clear component boundaries and data flow

**User Value**: Users can reposition elements within their SVG designs
**Testing**: Drag various element types and verify position updates are preserved

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Create useDrag custom hook for drag interactions
- [ ] Build DragHandler component with mouse/touch events
- [ ] Implement transform calculation utilities
- [ ] Add real-time visual feedback during drag operations
- [ ] Create UndoRedoContext for move operations
- [ ] Handle coordinate system transformations with React refs

### Iteration 4: Resize Handles & Scaling üìè
**Goal**: Add resize handles around selected elements using React components
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Deliverables**:
- ResizeHandles component with 8-point handles
- useResize custom hook for scaling logic
- Transform components for different element types
- Constraint options component (aspect ratio, etc.)

**User Value**: Users can resize elements to fit their design needs
**Testing**: Resize various shapes and verify transforms are applied correctly

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Create ResizeHandles component with positioned handles
- [ ] Build useResize hook for resize mathematics
- [ ] Implement constraint options (maintain aspect ratio, etc.)
- [ ] Create element-specific transform components
- [ ] Add visual feedback during resize operations
- [ ] Handle complex path elements and groups with React portals

### Iteration 5: Z-Order Management üìö
**Goal**: Provide React components for changing element stacking order
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Deliverables**:
- Toolbar component with z-order buttons
- LayerPanel component showing element hierarchy
- useZOrder custom hook for reordering logic
- Keyboard shortcut hooks for common operations

**User Value**: Users can control which elements appear in front of others
**Testing**: Test z-ordering with overlapping elements and verify visual stacking

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Create Toolbar component with z-order controls
- [ ] Build LayerPanel component with element tree
- [ ] Implement useZOrder hook for DOM manipulation
- [ ] Add useKeyboardShortcuts hook for common operations
- [ ] Handle z-ordering within groups using React context

## Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Handles SVGs up to reasonable complexity (1000+ elements)
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and tablet
- [ ] Leverages React ecosystem (hooks, context, components)
- [ ] Clean, maintainable React + TypeScript code with proper typing
- [ ] Efficient re-rendering with React.memo and useMemo optimizations

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive selection and manipulation
- [ ] Visual feedback for all operations
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Clear error messages and help text
- [ ] Fast performance even with complex SVGs

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for React components (React Testing Library)
- [ ] Integration tests for user workflows (Cypress/Playwright)
- [ ] Component testing with Storybook
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Performance testing with React DevTools Profiler
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen readers, ARIA)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex SVG Parsing**: Use React's dangerouslySetInnerHTML carefully, implement safe SVG parsing
- **Performance Issues**: Leverage React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for optimization
- **State Management Complexity**: Use Context API judiciously, consider Zustand for complex state
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use TypeScript and modern build tools (Vite) for better compatibility

### User Experience Risks
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Provide clear visual feedback and tooltips
- **Accidental Changes**: Implement robust undo/redo system
- **Lost Work**: Auto-save functionality or export reminders
