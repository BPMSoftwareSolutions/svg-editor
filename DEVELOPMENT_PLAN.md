# SVG Editor Development Plan

## Project Overview
Create a web-based SVG editor in TypeScript that allows users to:
- View SVG files
- Select individual SVG elements by clicking
- Move/drag elements to new positions
- Resize elements with handles
- Change element z-ordering (bring to front/send to back)

## Development Iterations

### Iteration 1: Foundation & Basic Viewer üèóÔ∏è
**Goal**: Create a working SVG viewer that can load and display SVG files
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Deliverables**:
- TypeScript project setup with proper build configuration
- HTML page with SVG container
- Basic SVG file loader (drag-and-drop or file input)
- SVG display in a viewport with pan/zoom capabilities

**User Value**: Users can load and view SVG files in the browser
**Testing**: Load various SVG files (simple shapes, complex illustrations) and verify proper display

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up package.json with TypeScript, Webpack/Vite, and dev dependencies
- [ ] Create tsconfig.json with appropriate compiler options
- [ ] Build HTML structure with file input and SVG container
- [ ] Implement SVG file reading and DOM injection
- [ ] Add basic viewport controls (pan/zoom)

### Iteration 2: Element Selection System üéØ
**Goal**: Enable clicking on SVG elements to select them with visual feedback
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverables**:
- Click-to-select functionality for any SVG element
- Visual selection indicator (outline/highlight)
- Element information display (tag name, attributes)
- Selection state management

**User Value**: Users can identify and select specific elements within complex SVGs
**Testing**: Click on various element types (circles, paths, groups) and verify selection feedback

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement event delegation for SVG element clicks
- [ ] Create selection state management system
- [ ] Add visual selection indicators (bounding box, outline)
- [ ] Build element inspector panel showing selected element details
- [ ] Handle nested elements and groups properly

### Iteration 3: Move & Drag Functionality üöö
**Goal**: Allow users to drag selected elements to new positions
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverables**:
- Drag-and-drop functionality for selected elements
- Real-time position updates during drag
- Snap-to-grid option (optional enhancement)
- Undo/redo for move operations

**User Value**: Users can reposition elements within their SVG designs
**Testing**: Drag various element types and verify position updates are preserved

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement mouse/touch drag event handlers
- [ ] Create transform calculation system for different element types
- [ ] Add real-time visual feedback during drag operations
- [ ] Handle coordinate system transformations
- [ ] Implement basic undo/redo stack for moves

### Iteration 4: Resize Handles & Scaling üìè
**Goal**: Add resize handles around selected elements for scaling
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Deliverables**:
- Resize handles (8-point: corners + midpoints) around selected elements
- Proportional and free-form resize options
- Visual feedback during resize operations
- Proper handling of different element types (circles, rectangles, paths)

**User Value**: Users can resize elements to fit their design needs
**Testing**: Resize various shapes and verify transforms are applied correctly

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Create resize handle rendering system
- [ ] Implement resize mathematics for different element types
- [ ] Add constraint options (maintain aspect ratio, etc.)
- [ ] Handle complex path elements and groups
- [ ] Update element attributes/transforms appropriately

### Iteration 5: Z-Order Management üìö
**Goal**: Provide controls to change element stacking order
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Deliverables**:
- Bring to front / Send to back buttons
- Move up / Move down one layer
- Visual layer indicator
- Layer panel showing element hierarchy

**User Value**: Users can control which elements appear in front of others
**Testing**: Test z-ordering with overlapping elements and verify visual stacking

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement DOM manipulation for element reordering
- [ ] Create toolbar with z-order controls
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- [ ] Build layer panel showing element stack
- [ ] Handle z-ordering within groups

### Iteration 6: Polish & User Experience ‚ú®
**Goal**: Enhance the interface and add professional polish
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Deliverables**:
- Professional CSS styling and layout
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Context menu for right-click operations
- Export functionality (save modified SVG)
- Error handling and user feedback

**User Value**: Professional, intuitive interface that's pleasant to use
**Testing**: Full end-to-end user workflow testing and usability validation

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Design and implement comprehensive CSS styling
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut system
- [ ] Create context menus for element operations
- [ ] Implement SVG export functionality
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Create user documentation/help system

## Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Handles SVGs up to reasonable complexity (1000+ elements)
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and tablet
- [ ] No external dependencies for core functionality
- [ ] Clean, maintainable TypeScript code with proper typing

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive selection and manipulation
- [ ] Visual feedback for all operations
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Clear error messages and help text
- [ ] Fast performance even with complex SVGs

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for user workflows
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Performance testing with large SVG files
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex SVG Parsing**: Start with simple shapes, gradually add support for complex paths
- **Performance Issues**: Implement virtualization for large SVGs if needed
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use TypeScript and modern build tools for better compatibility

### User Experience Risks
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Provide clear visual feedback and tooltips
- **Accidental Changes**: Implement robust undo/redo system
- **Lost Work**: Auto-save functionality or export reminders
