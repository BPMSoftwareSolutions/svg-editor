# Fix: Simplify and Stabilize Element Resize Logic

## Summary

This PR simplifies the resize implementation in `SelectionOverlay.tsx` to fix element jumping and inaccurate sizing during resize operations. The refactored code is more stable, accurate, and ~30 lines simpler.

## Problems Fixed

- ✅ **Element jumping**: Elements no longer jump or jitter during resize operations
- ✅ **Inaccurate sizing**: Elements now resize to the exact dimensions of the resize box
- ✅ **Position instability**: Position correction logic is now stable and predictable
- ✅ **Rotation handling**: Works correctly with rotated and transformed groups

## Root Cause

The original implementation had become overly complicated:

1. **Unstable position correction**: Complex multi-step calculations were executed on every mouse move, causing jittering
2. **Wrong reference point**: Code was trying to use changing `left/top` values instead of the fixed original position
3. **Cumulative errors**: Not consistently starting from the original transform led to drift

## Solution

Simplified the resize logic with a cleaner approach:

### Before
```typescript
// Complex multi-step process with multiple measurements
// Calculated positions in multiple coordinate systems
// Applied corrections multiple times
// Caused instability and jumping
```

### After
```typescript
// 1. Use original bounding box position as target
// 2. Apply scale transformation based on size ratio
// 3. Single position correction to keep top-left fixed
// 4. Always start from original transform (no cumulative errors)
```

## Key Changes

- Use **original bounding box position** as target (captured at resize start)
- Always start from **original transform** captured at resize start
- Apply **scale transformation once** per mouse move
- **Single position correction** step (not multiple iterations)
- Removed complex multi-step coordinate calculations

## Testing

All tests passing:

### Unit Tests
```
✓ ResizeElementCommand (17)
  ✓ Basic Element Resizing (4)
  ✓ Group Element Resizing (6)
  ✓ Path Element Resizing (2)
  ✓ Viewport Scale Handling (2)
  ✓ Edge Cases (3)
```

### Cypress Integration Tests
```
✓ Group Element Resizing (7)
  ✓ Basic Group Resize (2)
  ✓ Group Resize with Existing Transforms (2)
    ✓ should preserve position and rotation during resize ⭐ (was failing)
  ✓ Undo/Redo for Group Resize (2)
  ✓ Multiple Resize Operations (1)
```

## Files Changed

- `src/components/SelectionOverlay.tsx` - Simplified resize logic
- `RESIZE_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed technical documentation

## Benefits

1. **Simpler code**: Easier to understand and maintain (-30 lines of complexity)
2. **No jumping**: Elements stay stable during resize
3. **Accurate sizing**: Elements match the resize box dimensions exactly
4. **Works with rotation**: Correctly handles groups with rotate transforms
5. **Better performance**: Less DOM manipulation per frame

## How to Test

1. Load any SVG file with groups or complex elements
2. Select an element and drag a resize handle
3. Verify:
   - No jumping or jittering during resize
   - Element matches the resize box size exactly
   - Position stays stable
4. Try with rotated elements (apply rotation first, then resize)
5. Test undo/redo operations

## Documentation

See `RESIZE_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` for a detailed technical explanation of the changes, including:
- Problem analysis
- Solution approach
- How the new implementation works
- Comparison with old implementation

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a pure refactor with the same API and behavior (but more stable and accurate).
